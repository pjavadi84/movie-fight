### Movie Fight

We spend more time at home nowadays, and more time to skim through thousands of movies, but which one seems appealing. How can you decide which movie to watch and not wasting any more time deciding what to watch. You compare and this app is what it's all about. You can simply enter your movie information and a autocomplete feature will dropdown so you can choose, and compare another movie side-by-side. 

One of the cool things about this app is that the app's widget is reusable, meaning, regardless of what the data endpoint is the autocomplete widget can render the same feature of fetching data on autocomplete and perform the same behavior we may need useful in any other applications that we see this fit. 

I hope you enjoy this little simple, yet intuitive, app to your best use.
